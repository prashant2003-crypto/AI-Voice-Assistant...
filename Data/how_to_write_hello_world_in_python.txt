**Hello World in Python**
=========================

To write a "Hello World" program in Python, you can use the following code:

```python
# Print "Hello World" to the console
print("Hello World")
```

Let me explain what this code does:

* The `print()` function is used to output text to the console.
* The string `"Hello World"` is passed as an argument to the `print()` function.

**Example Use Case:**

1. Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or Sublime Text.
2. Create a new file with a `.py` extension, for example, `hello_world.py`.
3. Copy and paste the code into the file.
4. Save the file.
5. Run the file using Python, for example, by typing `python hello_world.py` in the terminal or command prompt.

**Output:**

When you run the program, you should see the following output:
```
Hello World
```

That's it! You have successfully written and run a "Hello World" program in Python.
