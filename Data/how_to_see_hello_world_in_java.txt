**Hello World in Java**
=========================

To write a "Hello World" program in Java, you can use the following code:

```java
// Define a public class called HelloWorld
public class HelloWorld {
    // Define the main method where the program starts execution
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Print "Hello World" to the console
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

Let me explain what this code does:

* The `public class HelloWorld` line defines a new public class called `HelloWorld`.
* The `public static void main(String[] args)` line defines the main method where the program starts execution.
* The `System.out.println("Hello World")` line uses the `println` method to print the string "Hello World" to the console, followed by a newline character.

**Example Use Case:**

1. Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse, NetBeans, or IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Create a new file with a `.java` extension, for example, `HelloWorld.java`.
3. Copy and paste the code into the file.
4. Save the file.
5. Compile the file using the `javac` command, for example, by typing `javac HelloWorld.java` in the terminal or command prompt.
6. Run the compiled file using the `java` command, for example, by typing `java HelloWorld` in the terminal or command prompt.

**Output:**

When you run the program, you should see the following output:
```
Hello World
```

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

### Using the Command Line

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you saved the `HelloWorld.java` file.
3. Compile the file using the `javac` command: `javac HelloWorld.java`
4. Run the compiled file using the `java` command: `java HelloWorld`

### Using an IDE

1. Open your IDE and create a new Java project.
2. Create a new Java class called `HelloWorld` and paste the code into it.
3. Click the "Run" button or press the corresponding keyboard shortcut to run the program.

That's it! You have successfully written and run a "Hello World" program in Java.
